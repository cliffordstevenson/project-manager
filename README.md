### User Story
```
AS a user, 
I WANT to be able to view my projects and the status of projects of teammembers
SO THAT I have quick access to the information and that specific tasks can be logged per project.
```

### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view, share and update the status of projects. This would facilitate effective collaboration amongst the team.
