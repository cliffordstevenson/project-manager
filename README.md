# Project-Manager System

## This Java project was designed for users to share projects, collaborate and update the status. The many-to-many relationship in the MySQL database allows users to edit each others projects, and switch teams. Users can provide specific tasks to each project, and update/share the status of these projects. The system is authenticated and allows for login and registration.  

* Java, SpringBoot and Bootstrap is used for creating the user interface
* MySQL is used for the database locally on my device
