### User Story
```
AS a user, 
I WANT to be able to view my projects and the status of projects of teammembers
SO THAT I have quick access to the information and that specific tasks can be logged per project.
```

### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view, share and update the status of projects. This would facilitate effective collaboration amongst the team.

## This Java project was designed for users to share projects, collaborate and update the status. The many-to-many relationship in the MySQL database allows users to edit each others projects, and switch teams. Users can provide specific tasks to each project, and update/share the status of these projects. The system is authenticated and allows for login and registration.  

* Java, SpringBoot and Bootstrap is used for creating the user interface
* MySQL is used for the database locally on my device
